/*A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWor
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList,
 return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, 
 or 0 if no such sequence exists.*/
